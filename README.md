# About the Project

This is an analysis project for Juara Turtle Project on Tioman Island, Malaysia.

Founded in 2006, Juara Turtle Project runs a number of volunteer based conservation projects to manage the impact of pollution and threats to the environment on Tioman island, a small island off the South-East coast of Malaysia. And one of those projects is sea turtle conservation.

During my one-week volunteer time there in August 2023, I learned that there has been an ongoing "epidemic" in the local turtle population, which is a widespread fungus infection of the turtle eggs after the eggs are laid and buried under beach sand pit for hatching. The source, cause and impact of the infection are still under investigation, but the local staff are concerned about the infection and its possible impact on the turtle hatch rate. More generally, __JTP wants to understand which factors would impact the hatch rate and in what ways.__

## About the Data Set
The dataset used in this analysis is provided by JTP, which is a record of the turtle nesting data from 2017 to 2022, including the number of eggs laid/hatched, where the eggs were laid, the turtle species, measurements of sample eggs, relocation time etc. 

## Methodology
* Language: Python
* Analysis Model: Generalized Linear Regression
